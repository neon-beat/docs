# Neon Beat documentation

## Brief 

This repository contains basic documentation about the Neon Beat blindtest.
This repository has been created during the early steps of Neon Beat
development, so it contains documentation about both the early desired
features and the resulting architecture decisions.

## Generating and using the docs

The repository contains both textual documentation and graphs
- the textual documentation can be reviewed directly in any text viewer, or
  better, markdown viewer
- the graphs can be generated from their textual descriptions thanks to the
  root Makefile, just type `make` and it will generate .png files
